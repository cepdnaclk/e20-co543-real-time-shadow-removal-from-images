___
![image missing]()

Shadows can significantly impact image quality and hinder accurate object recognition in various computer vision applications. The Real-Time Shadow Removal Project aims to develop an efficient algorithm that detects and removes shadows from images and videos in real time, improving visual clarity and enabling better image processing for applications like surveillance, autonomous navigation, and augmented reality.

## Features
  - Shadow region detection
  - Shadow area removal and image enhancement
  - Real time processing

## Project Overview

Key Techniques Used
Shadow detection: Using image features such as color gradients, texture, and intensity values to identify shadow regions.
Shadow removal: Applying inpainting or image processing techniques to fill the detected shadow regions with realistic pixel values.
Real-time processing: Optimizing the algorithm to run on video streams or high-resolution images without significant delays.
