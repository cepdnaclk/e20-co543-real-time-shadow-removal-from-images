Shadows in images often lead to reduced visual quality, inaccurate object detection, and poor analysis. Real-world applications (e.g., surveillance, robotics, autonomous vehicles) require accurate and clear image processing under varying lighting conditions. Therefore image enhancement via shadow removal is a vital part in image processing.

## Features
  - Shadow region detection
  - Shadow area removal and image enhancement
  - Real time processing

## Project Overview

### Key Techniques Used
  - Shadow detection: Using image features such as color gradients, texture, and intensity values to identify shadow regions.
  - Shadow removal: Applying image processing techniques to fill the detected shadow regions with realistic pixel values.
  - Real-time processing: Optimizing the algorithm to run on high-resolution images without significant delays.
